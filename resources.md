##### Blogs and social media

I find that social media -- in the right dosage -- can be an important tool for scientists in keeping track of the state of the art. Here are some blogs I follow that I find particularly useful.

* [Bits of DNA](https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/) by [Lior Pachter](https://pachterlab.github.io/index.html)
* [MathBabe](https://mathbabe.org/) by Cathy O'Neil
* [Natural Language Processing Blog](https://nlpers.blogspot.com/) by [Hal Daum√© III](https://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/)
* [Updated Sporadically at Best](https://jxyzabc.blogspot.com/) by [Jean Wang](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jyang2/index.html)

If you're on Twitter, I would recommend following (among many others):

* [Yaniv Erlich](https://twitter.com/erlichya)
* [Jen Golbeck](https://twitter.com/jengolbeck)
* [Michael Hoffman](https://twitter.com/michaelhoffman)
* [nextgenseek](https://twitter.com/nextgenseek)
* [Quaid Morris](https://twitter.com/quaidmorris)

##### Miscellany
Including tools I've helped build, datasets I've helped create, etc.

* [WordBias.org](http://wordbias.org) and [Hacking Bias in Word Choice](https://mdml.github.io/hacking-bias-in-word-choice): visualize gender bias in word choice in these two web apps.
* [Cited by](https://mdml.github.io/cited-by): interactively filter a given PubMed paper's citations.

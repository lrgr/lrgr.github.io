      <h5>Nick Franzese (Ph.D. student)</h5>
      <p>
        Nicholas Franzese is a computer scientist, a biologist, and a computational biologist.
        He received his undergraduate degree from Reed College with the help of thesis advisors Anna Ritz and Adam Groce.
        Nick's research interests are tied together by a common theme: modelling that aligns powerful computational methods with intuitive biological narratives.
        His current research applies probabilistic graphical models to cancer data.
        These models learn distributions from data informed by a priori notions of causal structure within biological systems, facilitating results that are accurate and understandable by humans.

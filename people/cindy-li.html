      <h5>Cindy Li (Ph.D. student)</h5>
      <p>
        Xuan Cindy Li is a 1st year PhD student in the Biological Sciences Graduate Program at the University of Maryland. Cindy hails from Guangzhou, China, but spent her undergrad at Washington University in St. Louis and therefore considers herself half St. Louisian (Go Cards!). During her rotation with the Leiserson Group, Cindy is exploring algorithms predicting synthetic lethality and genetic interactions across different species.

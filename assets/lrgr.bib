  title={Multiplatform Analysis of 12 Cancer Types Reveals Molecular Classification within and across Tissues of Origin},

  pmid={25109877},
  abstract={Recent genomic analyses of pathologically defined tumor types identify “within-a-tissue” disease subtypes. However, the extent to which genomic signatures are shared across tissues is still unclear. We~performed an integrative analysis using five genome-wide platforms and one proteomic platform on 3,527 specimens from 12 cancer types, revealing a unified classification into 11 major subtypes. Five subtypes were nearly identical to their tissue-of-origin counterparts, but several distinct cancer types were found to converge into common subtypes. Lung~squamous, head and neck, and a subset of bladder cancers coalesced into one subtype typified by {TP53} alterations, {TP63} amplifications, and high expression of immune and proliferation pathway genes. Of note, bladder cancers split into three pan-cancer subtypes. The multiplatform classification, while correlated with tissue-of-origin, provides independent information for predicting clinical outcomes. All data sets are available for data-mining from a unified resource to support further biological discoveries and insights into novel therapeutic strategies.},

  pmid={25501392},
  abstract={Cancers exhibit extensive mutational heterogeneity, and the resulting long-tail phenomenon complicates the discovery of genes and pathways that are significantly mutated in cancer. We perform a pan-cancer analysis of mutated networks in 3,281 samples from 12 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas {(TCGA)} using {HotNet2,} a new algorithm to find mutated subnetworks that overcomes the limitations of existing single-gene, pathway and network approaches. We identify 16 significantly mutated subnetworks that comprise well-known cancer signaling pathways as well as subnetworks with less characterized roles in cancer, including cohesin, condensin and others. Many of these subnetworks exhibit co-occurring mutations across samples. These subnetworks contain dozens of genes with rare somatic mutations across multiple cancers; many of these genes have additional evidence supporting a role in cancer. By illuminating these rare combinations of mutations, pan-cancer network analyses provide a roadmap to investigate new diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities across cancer types.},

  issn={{1553-734X}},
  pmid={23717195},
  abstract={Distinguishing the somatic mutations responsible for cancer (driver mutations) from random, passenger mutations is a key challenge in cancer genomics. Driver mutations generally target cellular signaling and regulatory pathways consisting of multiple genes. This heterogeneity complicates the identification of driver mutations by their recurrence across samples, as different combinations of mutations in driver pathways are observed in different samples. We introduce the {Multi-Dendrix} algorithm for the simultaneous identification of multiple driver pathways de novo in somatic mutation data from a cohort of cancer samples. The algorithm relies on two combinatorial properties of mutations in a driver pathway: high coverage and mutual exclusivity. We derive an integer linear program that finds set of mutations exhibiting these properties. We apply {Multi-Dendrix} to somatic mutations from glioblastoma, breast cancer, and lung cancer samples. {Multi-Dendrix} identifies sets of mutations in genes that overlap with known pathways – including Rb, p53, {PI(3)K,} and cell cycle pathways – and also novel sets of mutually exclusive mutations, including mutations in several transcription factors or other genes involved in transcriptional regulation. These sets are discovered directly from mutation data with no prior knowledge of pathways or gene interactions. We show that {Multi-Dendrix} outperforms other algorithms for identifying combinations of mutations and is also orders of magnitude faster on genome-scale data.

Here we describe a comprehensive molecular evaluation of 295 primary gastric adenocarcinomas as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas {(TCGA)} project. We propose a molecular classification dividing gastric cancer into four subtypes: tumours positive for {Epstein–Barr} virus, which display recurrent {PIK3CA} mutations, extreme {DNA} hypermethylation, and amplification of {JAK2,} {CD274} (also known as {PD-L1)} and {PDCD1LG2} (also known as {PD-L2);} microsatellite unstable tumours, which show elevated mutation rates, including mutations of genes encoding targetable oncogenic signalling proteins; genomically stable tumours, which are enriched for the diffuse histological variant and mutations of {RHOA} or fusions involving {RHO-family} {GTPase-activating} proteins; and tumours with chromosomal instability, which show marked aneuploidy and focal amplification of receptor tyrosine kinases. Identification of these subtypes provides a roadmap for patient stratification and trials of targeted therapies.},

Unlike previous methods, which also consider physical protein-protein interaction data, our method utilizes genetic interaction data only; this becomes increasingly important as high-throughput genetic interaction data is becoming available in settings where less is known about physical interaction data. We compare modules and {BPMs} obtained to previous methods and across different datasets. Despite needing no physical interaction information, the {BPMs} produced by our method are competitive with previous methods.

  pmid={23634996},
  abstract={Background Many mutations that contribute to the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia {(AML)} are undefined. The relationships between patterns of mutations and epigenetic phenotypes are not yet clear. Methods We analyzed the genomes of 200 clinically annotated adult cases of de novo {AML,} using either whole-genome sequencing (50 cases) or whole-exome sequencing (150 cases), along with {RNA} and {microRNA} sequencing and {DNA-methylation} analysis. Results {AML} genomes have fewer mutations than most other adult cancers, with an average of only 13 mutations found in genes. Of these, an average of 5 are in genes that are recurrently mutated in {AML.} A total of 23 genes were significantly mutated, and another 237 were mutated in two or more samples. Nearly all samples had at least 1 nonsynonymous mutation in one of nine categories of genes that are almost certainly relevant for pathogenesis, including transcription-factor fusions (18\% of cases), the gene encoding nucleophosmin {(NPM1)} (27\%), tumor-suppressor genes (16\%), {DNA-methylation–related} genes (44\%), signaling genes (59\%), chromatin-modifying genes (30\%), myeloid transcription-factor genes (22\%), cohesin-complex genes (13\%), and spliceosome-complex genes (14\%). Patterns of cooperation and mutual exclusivity suggested strong biologic relationships among several of the genes and categories. Conclusions We identified at least one potential driver mutation in nearly all {AML} samples and found that a complex interplay of genetic events contributes to {AML} pathogenesis in individual patients. The databases from this study are widely available to serve as a foundation for further investigations of {AML} pathogenesis, classification, and risk stratification. {(Funded} by the National Institutes of Health.)},

  abstract={Between-pathway models {(BPMs)} are network motifs consisting of pairs of putative redundant pathways. In this article, we show how adding another source of high-throughput data--microarray gene expression data from knockout experiments--allows us to identify a compensatory functional relationship between genes from the two {BPM} pathways. We evaluate the quality of the {BPMs} from four different studies, and we describe how our methods might be extended to refine pathways.},
